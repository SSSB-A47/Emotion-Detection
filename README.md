# Emotion-Detection
“Real‑time emotion detection classifies facial (or text/audio) inputs into emotions like happy, sad, angry using CNNs, LSTMs or transformer models. Trained on datasets (e.g. FER‑2013, RAVDESS), it detects emotions via webcam or text/audio, ideal for interactive, empathetic apps.”
